Head pose estimation is one of the computer vision tasks that exist. In this task, we want to know the objectâ€™s pose from its translation and rotation.
As you know, we have only a two-dimensional image. How can we estimate the pose of an object by relying on the image itself? We can use a solution called the Perspective-n-Point (PnP).
if we want to solve PnP problem we need to know the 2D coordinates in the image and corrosponding 3D coordinates in the world space
